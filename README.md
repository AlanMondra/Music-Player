# Music-Player

In order to run this program you have to options: 

1) Run it on a terminal as normal python file


2) Create a Desktop file to run directly on your desktop

a) To create this shorcut: you need to create a file like the "prueba_8" where you only specify the path of the main file and the command on terminal to run the python file.
b) Ones you have the path on that file, you need to create the desktop file just like the "Act4_m4.desktop" file and change the path where the previous file was located ("prueba_8"), and the path to the icon you want to watch on your shortcut (optional).
